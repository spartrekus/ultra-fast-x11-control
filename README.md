# ultra-fast-x11-control
U1tra-fast-x11-control for dual monitors is a method to control the x11 server via only the terminal.

You may type a...z, 0...9, and make use of your distant connection over ssh to control the computer x11 server. It requires only ssh, xdotool and screen. It is thus the one of the fastest way to somehow control a distant running x11 server. 

You may run screen with: screen -d -m -S mysession  and  with  screen -x mysession.

Enjoy this method which is much much faster than VNC if you have a slow internet/wlan/lan connection.
